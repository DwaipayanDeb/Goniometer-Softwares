# Goniometer-Softwares
This project is created to facilitate anyone who is interested to know how I automated the goniomter described in my publication "Making an Efficient but Cost Effective Automated Goniometeric Device for Light Scattering Study". It contains the Arduino codes for the master unit and two slave units (same file) and also the computer program 'Goniomter Controller'. I thank www.tutorialspoint.com which helped me a lot to develope the arduino codes. The computer software 'Goniometer Controller' is written in VB.net language. Anyone having any question, may contact me at dwaipayandeb@yahoo.co.in
